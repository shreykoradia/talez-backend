# Talez: Collaborative Ideation and Feedback Platform

**Welcome to Talez!**

Talez is a SaaS platform designed for users and stakeholders to share ideas, gather collective feedback, and engage in thorough discussions to reach conclusive decisions. Unlike traditional scrum meetings, Talez fosters collaboration without the time constraints of formal meetings, allowing for in-depth conversations to unfold organically.

**Key Features**

- Idea Collaboration: Talez provides a space for users to brainstorm, propose features, or discuss modules collaboratively. It goes beyond the limitations of traditional scrum meetings, enabling a dynamic exchange of insights.

- Collective Feedback: Users can gather feedback from various stakeholders in real-time, creating a more inclusive decision-making process. Talez streamlines the feedback loop, making it efficient and accessible to all team members.

**Not an Alternative to Scrum Meetings, But...**

Talez is not positioned as an alternative to scrum meetings, which primarily serve to track task deadlines and sprint progress. Instead, Talez complements the scrum methodology by offering a dedicated platform for discussing blockers, exploring new ideas, and gaining different perspectives on project-related matters.

For example, if you need to brainstorm a new feature or module, you can open a new idea on Talez and initiate a collaborative discussion. To learn more, star the repository and join the waiting list for early access to Talez.

**Open-Source Initiative**

Is Talez an open-source SaaS platform? As of now, the decision is pending. I am Shrey Koradia, the creator and maintainer of Talez, working diligently to optimize your business processes with the aim of making it go "Bizzzz."
